SHIFT + CLICK while standing on a weapon to pick it up

UI is currently nonexistant, so to customize your weapon go to the content browser and go to Content > Pickups > Guns > BP_WeaponBase.
In the event graph there are 5 slots to manually insert bullets/modifiers into your weapon's inventory.

The Stasis modifier/bullet requires UnStatis further down the line with at least one bullet inbetween them.

Not all bullets and modifiers are implelemted yet, so here is a list of everything functional:

BULLETS:
None, Regular Bullet, Explosive, Sawblade, Electric, Teleport, Rocket, Statis/UnStasis

MODIFIERS:
Cooldown, Speed, Damage, Lifetime, Twin, Chain, Piercing
